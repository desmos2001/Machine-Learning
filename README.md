L1 regularization penalizes the sum of absolute values of the weights, whereas L2 regularization penalizes the sum of squares of the weights. 
The L1 regularization solution is sparse. The L2 regularization solution is non-sparse.
L2 regularization doesnâ€™t perform feature selection, since weights are only reduced to values near 0 instead of 0. L1 regularization has built-in feature selection.
L1 regularization is robust to outliers, L2 regularization is not.
